For most games and apps made with 4.5 it should be relatively safe to migrate to 4.6. This page intends to cover everything you need to pay attention to when migrating your project.

## Breaking changes

If you are migrating from 4.5 to 4.6, the breaking changes listed here might affect you. Changes are grouped by areas/systems.

This article indicates whether each breaking change affects GDScript and whether the C# breaking change is *binary compatible* or *source compatible*:

- **Binary compatible** - Existing binaries will load and execute successfully without recompilation, and the run-time behavior won't change.
- **Source compatible** - Source code will compile successfully without changes when upgrading Godot.

## Behavior changes

### Android

> [!note] Note
> The source sets configuration for Android export templates has been updated to match the default Android Studio project structure ([GH-110829](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/110829)). This affects the directory layout of the Android project:
> 
> - Files previously in `[Project root]/android/build/src/` are now in `[Project root]/android/build/src/main/java/`.
> - Android manifest file and assets directory have been moved to `src/main/` subdirectories.
> 
> For example, `GodotApp.java` moved from `src/com/godot/game/GodotApp.java` to `src/main/java/com/godot/game/GodotApp.java`.

### Core

> [!note] Note
> The [TSCN file format](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/engine_details/file_formats/tscn.html#doc-tscn-file-format) has changed in two ways in Godot 4.6:
> 
> - `load_steps` is no longer written in scene files ([GH-103352](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/103352)). This attribute wasn't used by the editor.
> - Unique node IDs are now saved to scene files to help track nodes when they are moved or renamed ([GH-106837](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/106837)). This makes scene refactoring significantly more robust.
> 
> The changes are backwards-compatible and forwards-compatible, which means scenes saved in Godot 4.5 can still be loaded in Godot 4.6 and vice-versa (notwithstanding other incompatible changes performed in the scene itself).
> 
> As a result, when saving a scene that was last edited in Godot 4.5 in Godot 4.6, significant diffs will occur in version control programs. These diffs are expected.
> 
> As a reminder, you can upgrade all files in a project to the latest format using in the editor, then committing the changes to version control. This allows you to avoid large diffs later on when editing scenes.

### Rendering

> [!note] Note
> The default blend mode for Glow is now Screen, which looks more correct but is significantly brighter than the previous Soft Light mode ([GH-110671](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/110671)).
> 
> Several other glow defaults were changed to ensure the glow didn't become too strong, but you will likely need to tweak glow properties in Environment after upgrading.
> 
> In addition, glow's Soft Light blend mode now always behaves as it did previously with `use_hdr_2d`, regardless of the Viewport's `use_hdr_2d` setting ([GH-109971](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/109971)).
> 
> When using the Mobile renderer, the rewritten glow effect will look significantly different to the previous one for performance reasons ([GH-110077](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/110077)). You may need to further adjust glow settings in Environment to achieve a similar look to before.

> [!note] Note
> Volumetric fog blending has been changed to be more physically accurate ([GH-112494](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/112494)). This will cause volumetric fog to appear brighter in most scenes.
> 
> To compensate for this, you will need to decrease volumetric fog density or brightness in Environment, or decrease the **Volumetric Fog Energy** property on specific lights.

## Changed defaults

The following default values have been changed. If your project relies on the previous defaults, you may need to explicitly set them to the old values.

> [!note] Note
> The default rendering driver on Windows for **newly created** projects is now D3D12 ([GH-113213](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/113213)). This can be changed in Project Settings under `rendering/rendering_device/driver.windows`.

> [!note] Note
> The default 3D physics engine for **newly created** projects is now Jolt Physics ([GH-105737](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105737)). This can be changed in Project Settings under `physics/3d/physics_engine`.

### 3D

| Member | Old Value | New Value | Introduced |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MeshInstance3D** |  |  |  |
| Property `skeleton` | NodePath("..") | NodePath("") | [GH-112267](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/112267) |

> [!note] Note
> The default value of `skeleton` has changed. Enable `animation/compatibility/default_parent_skeleton_in_mesh_instance_3d` in Project Settings if the old behavior is needed for compatibility.
