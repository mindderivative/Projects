## Process material properties

![ParticleProcessMaterial properties](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/particle_minmaxcurve.webp)

Min, max, and curve properties 

The properties in this material control how particles behave and change over their lifetime. A lot of them have `Min`, `Max`, and `Curve` values that allow you to fine-tune their behavior. The relationship between these values is this: When a particle is spawned, the property is set with a random value between `Min` and `Max`. If `Min` and `Max` are the same, the value will always be the same for every particle. If the `Curve` is also set, the value of the property will be multiplied by the value of the curve at the current point in a particle's lifetime. Use the curve to change a property over the particle lifetime. Very complex behavior can be expressed this way.

> [!note] Note
> This page covers how to use ParticleProcessMaterial for 2D scenes specifically. For information on how to use it in a 3D scene see [Process material properties](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/particles/process_material_properties.html#doc-process-material-properties).

### Lifetime Randomness

The `Lifetime Randomness` property controls how much randomness to apply to each particle's lifetime. A value of `0` means there is no randomness at all and all particles live for the same amount of time, set by the [Lifetime](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/particles/properties.html#doc-3d-particles-properties-time) property. A value of `1` means that a particle's lifetime is completely random within the range of \[0.0, `Lifetime`\].

## Particle Flags

## Spawn

### Angle

Determines the initial angle of the particle (in degrees). This parameter is mostly useful randomized.

### Velocity

#### Direction

This is the base direction at which particles emit. The default is `Vector3(1, 0, 0)` which makes particles emit to the right. However, with the default gravity settings, particles will go straight down.

![../../_images/direction1.png](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/direction1.png)

For this property to be noticeable, you need an *initial velocity* greater than 0. Here, we set the initial velocity to 40. You'll notice that particles emit toward the right, then go down because of gravity.

![../../_images/direction2.png](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/direction2.png)

#### Spread

This parameter is the angle in degrees which will be randomly added in either direction to the base `Direction`. A spread of `180` will emit in all directions (+/- 180). For spread to do anything the "Initial Velocity" parameter must be greater than 0.

![../../_images/paranim3.gif](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/paranim3.gif)

#### Flatness

This property is only useful for 3D particles.

#### Initial Velocity

Initial velocity is the speed at which particles will be emitted (in pixels/sec). Speed might later be modified by gravity or other accelerations (as described further below).

## Display

### Scale

Determines the initial scale of the particles.

### Color Curves

#### Color

Used to change the color of the particles being emitted.

### Hue Variation

The `Variation` value sets the initial hue variation applied to each particle. The `Variation Random` value controls the hue variation randomness ratio.

### Animation

> [!note] Note
> Particle flipbook animation is only effective if the CanvasItemMaterial used on the GPUParticles2D or CPUParticles2D node has been [configured accordingly](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/particle_systems_2d.html#doc-particle-systems-2d-using-flipbook).

To set up the particle flipbook for linear playback, set the **Speed Min** and **Speed Max** values to 1:

![Setting up particle animation for playback during the particle's lifetime](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/particles_flipbook_configure_animation_speed.webp)

Setting up particle animation for playback during the particle's lifetime 

By default, looping is disabled. If the particle is done playing before its lifetime ends, the particle will keep using the flipbook's last frame (which may be fully transparent depending on how the flipbook texture is designed). If looping is enabled, the animation will loop back to the first frame and resume playing.

Depending on how many images your sprite sheet contains and for how long your particle is alive, the animation might not look smooth. The relationship between particle lifetime, animation speed, and number of images in the sprite sheet is this:

> [!note] Note
> At an animation speed of `1.0`, the animation will reach the last image in the sequence just as the particle's lifetime ends.
> 
> $$
> A n i m a t i o n F P S = \frac{N u m b e r o f i m a g e s}{L i f e t i m e}
> $$

If you wish the particle flipbook to be used as a source of random particle textures for every particle, keep the speed values at 0 and set **Offset Max** to 1 instead:

![Setting up particle animation for random offset on emission](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/particles_flipbook_configure_animation_offset.webp)

Setting up particle animation for random offset on emission 

Note that the GPUParticles2D node's **Fixed FPS** also affects animation playback. For smooth animation playback, it's recommended to set it to 0 so that the particle is simulated on every rendered frame. If this is not an option for your use case, set **Fixed FPS** to be equal to the effective framerate used by the flipbook animation (see above for the formula).

## Emission Shapes

ParticleProcessMaterials allow you to set an Emission Mask, which dictates the area and direction in which particles are emitted. These can be generated from textures in your project.

Ensure that a ParticleProcessMaterial is set, and the GPUParticles2D node is selected. A "Particles" menu should appear in the Toolbar:

![../../_images/emission_shapes1.webp](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/emission_shapes1.webp)

Open it and select "Load Emission Mask":

![../../_images/emission_shapes2.webp](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/emission_shapes2.webp)

Then select which texture you want to use as your mask:

![../../_images/emission_shapes3.webp](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/emission_shapes3.webp)

A dialog box with several settings will appear.

### Emission Mask

Three types of emission masks can be generated from a texture:

- Solid Pixels: Particles will spawn from any area of the texture, excluding transparent areas.
![../../_images/emission_mask_solid.gif](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/emission_mask_solid.gif)
- Border Pixels: Particles will spawn from the outer edges of the texture.
![../../_images/emission_mask_border.gif](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/emission_mask_border.gif)
- Directed Border Pixels: Similar to Border Pixels, but adds extra information to the mask to give particles the ability to emit away from the borders. Note that an `Initial Velocity` will need to be set in order to utilize this.
![../../_images/emission_mask_directed_border.gif](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/emission_mask_directed_border.gif)

### Emission Colors

`Capture from Pixel` will cause the particles to inherit the color of the mask at their spawn points.

Once you click "OK", the mask will be generated and set to the ParticleProcessMaterial, under `Spawn` and then `Position`

![../../_images/emission_shapes4.webp](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/emission_shapes4.webp)

All of the values within this section have been automatically generated by the "Load Emission Mask" menu, so they should generally be left alone.

> [!note] Note
> An image should not be added to `Point Texture` or `Color Texture` directly. The "Load Emission Mask" menu should always be used instead.

## Customizing the process material

If you need to change or implement new behaviors in shader code, you can do so by converting the current ParticleProcessMaterial to a [ShaderMaterial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_shadermaterial.html#class-shadermaterial). Existing properties are preserved by the conversion process. Features that are enabled will also affect what's present in the converted shader code.

To do so, right-click on the material in the FileSystem dock and choose **Convert to ShaderMaterial**. You can also do so by right-clicking on any property holding a reference to the material in the inspector.
